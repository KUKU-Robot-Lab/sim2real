    #

    #   hold at rest    10.00   real hold, upright, at the goal, still, growing with successes
    #   first success   60.00   one-off; later successes 2.0, so staying pays, not re-arriving
    #
    # STRUCTURAL RULES, every one of them a scar from an earlier round:
    #  (a) Everything from "transport" down is x `off_table`, a smooth function of the object's rise
    #      above its OWN spawn height: nothing there pays while the object rests (round 10).
    #  (b) Stage one is ALWAYS profitable: no factor zeroes the long-range approach and no penalty
    #      exceeds the income of the stage the policy is in (round 11).
    #  (c) The hand is paid to stay OPEN only on the way in: the open-pose factor fades with palm
    #      distance (round 12 arrived curled; round 13 parked a flat open hand on the wall).
    #  (d) Palm seating is paired with finger engagement, never paid on proximity alone (round 13).
    #  (e) ROUND 15: NO PENALTY IS PROPORTIONAL TO A PERSISTENT LATCH. Round 14 charged
    #      8 x lifted x (1 - held): after one lift every later step without a full hold cost 8 until
    #      the episode ended, it became the largest term (-0.5 to -0.96/step) while the right arm was
    #      at its best, and the arm unlearned lifting, then grasping, and moved 0.29 m away. Losing
    #      the object now costs a bounded amount ONLY WHILE IT IS FALLING (current vertical velocity),
    #      setting it down costs only WHILE IT COMES DOWN onto the table, and the main cost of a drop
    #      is the lift / transport / hold income that stops. `lifted` survives only as the switch
    #      that stops the rise bonus from being paid twice (income, never negative).
    #
    # Steady states: grasp parked on the table ~1.2 early, ~0.2 late; lifted a few cm ~5;
